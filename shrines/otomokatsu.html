    <div class="container" id="who">
        <p><b>*</b> Welcome to my Katsuhiro Ōtomo fan page.</p>
        <p>Katsuhiro Otomo <b>大友克洋</b> is a manga artist, writer, and movie director born in 1954. As a child living somewhere rural with not much to do, he read a lot of comics. Otomo was inspired by Osamu Tezuka <b>手塚治虫</b> and Mitsuteru Yokoyama <b>横山光輝</b> whose works he would copy in his youth.</p>
        <p>It was during high school that Otomo took an  interest in movies. This was when his desire to become an artist was realized and most likely why his art and composition feels so cinematic in general.</p>
        <p>His career began in 1973 with his debut work Jūsei <b>銃声;</b> published when he was 19 years old. The majority of his most influential and popular works were made in his mid- to late 20s. Later in his career he became less focused on manga publication and more on movie direction.</p>
        <p>Otomo has won many awards for his work and he's often called one of the best manga artists of the century. He's made numerous contributions to the worlds of manga, film, and animation. He was sort of the main artist of the <b>New Wave</b> movement in manga. Countless other creatives cite him as inspiration for their own works.</p>
        <p>I'm not lying when I say Otomo is accomplished and his work is amazing. His artistic ability shouldn't be understated. But sometimes I feel like the deeper meanings and humanity in his work get ignored, his art condensed to aesthetic. With <b>AKIRA</b> this is particularly rampant. I hope my page gets someone out there to approach his work with some new curiosity.</p>
        <p>I recommend browsing <a href="https://chronotomo.aaandnn.com/" target="_blank">ChronOtomo</a> if you're interested. This website aims to catalogue everything Otomo-related. Older work included. It's a good resource for Otomo stuff in general.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="early-work">
        <p><strong>EARLY WORK</strong></p>
        <p>A lot of Otomo's early work focused on bite-sized ideas that didn't follow from one publication to the next. He worked on these one-shots almost exclusively. Sometimes he published works that were only a page or two long. Many times he would adapt someone else's story into an illustrated format.</p>
        <p>Otomo's prescribed genre has always been <b>seinen.</b> He focuses on sci-fi elements like psychokinesis and futuristic machinery while exploring political drama and action. This isn't to say he hasn't touched other settings and topics before. It's just clear he has a preferred way of telling his stories. Behind all these detailed drawings of machines and extraordinary powers are often themes of inter-personal struggle.</p>
        <p>Often forgotten by casual fans, both <b>Fire-Ball</b> (1979) and <b>Dōmu</b> (1980) planted the seeds for the later success of <b>AKIRA.</b> Both are expertly illustrated like always. <b>Fire-Ball</b> with its intense story cut short and <b>Dōmu</b> with its cast of characters navigating apartment complex drama with psychic action. It's important to remember these works as more than stepping stones.</p>

        <p><strong>アキラ & FILM</strong></p>
        <p>Otomo is most well-known for writing and illustrating <b>AKIRA</b> as well as directing the 1988 film adaptation of the same name. The manga began publication in Kodansha's <i>Young Magazine</i> in 1982 and ended the summer of 1990, totaling 120 episodes. It was also compiled into 6 tankōbon volumes.</p>
        <p>This was the first time he worked on such a long project. Kodansha had wanted a longer series from him, and with <b>Fire-Ball</b> and <b>Dōmu</b> laying the groundwork a couple years before, everything had lined up nice.</p>
        <p>Sci-fi action, motorcycle gangs, political and socio-economic commentary and drama, government experiments, and psychic powers all contained in more than 2,000 pages. Everyone knows about <b>AKIRA.</b> At least, they should. It's all of these things, but at its core it's a story about relationships and humanity. Losing humanity. It's amazing. I'm struggling to keep this brief because this isn't an <b>AKIRA</b> page...</p>
        <p>His career exploded in the wake of <b>AKIRA</b> and it was quickly recognized by the audience of <i>Young Magazine</i> that Otomo was doing something that hadn't really been done before. He was approached to make a movie adaptation of the manga even though it wasn't complete at the time. Otomo had directed segments for animated movies before - <i>Construction Cancellation Order</i> and <i>Robot Carnival</i> - but hadn't directed an entire film yet. He was interested, but he would only do it if he kept creative control over the project.</p>
        <p>And so <b>AKIRA</b> was put on the big screen. <b>AKIRA (1988)</b> is praised for its animation and score, the immense amount of work poured into it. It's a movie that invented new colors for animation, helped bring animanga to the West, and so much more. Today it's largely referenced by one scene alone. To true fans of <b>AKIRA</b> it's more than a motorcycle drift, some neon background shots of a city, and an explosion.</p>
        <p>After <b>AKIRA</b> woke up and took the world by storm, Otomo moved onto other projects. He did this often, not wanting to stick to one thing for too long. It was around this time he drifted from chiefly publishing manga and tested his directorial skills. Otomo worked on other films in the years following <b>AKIRA,</b> these being <b>Memories</b> (1995) and <b>Steamboy</b> (2004).</p>
        <p>While not the main director of <b>Memories,</b> the short <i>Magnetic Rose</i> was based on a story Otomo had published years ago. <i>Stink Bomb</i> was scripted by Otomo. <i>Cannon Fodder</i> was entirely written and directed by him. These three shorts follow wildly different stories and are each amazing in their own right. My favorite is <i>Magnetic Rose.</i></p>
        <p><b>Steamboy</b> was Otomo's second animated film as writer and director. Admittedly, I still haven't watched this movie. If you like steampunk then check it out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="influence">
        <p><strong>LEGACY</strong></p>
        <p>Otomo's fame didn't start right at <b>AKIRA.</b> It was actually after the publication of his short story collection <b>Short Peace</b> in 1979 that he gained some notoriety for his work. During and after <b>AKIRA,</b> though, Otomo's career would never be the same. The trajectory he was thrown on was almost cosmic.</p>
        <p>Many famous creatives have been inspired by him. There's too many to realistically list them all here. Game designers, other manga artists, and filmmakers. I'm sure one of you out there has a favorite artist who once said they were inspired by <b>AKIRA</b> or Otomo in general. One person I will name is Satoshi Kon <b>今 敏.</b> He worked as an assistant with Otomo on many projects and was sort of a student of his. A friend. He was influenced by both <b>AKIRA</b> and <b>Dōmu.</b> I don't need to tell you about the work he did.</p>
        <p>The lasting legacy of Otomo started early and it hasn't stopped. He's got the awards to prove himself; he's worked with other creatives on countless projects. Otomo will go down in history as one of the best artists to have ever lived.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="personal">
        <p><strong>PERSONAL</strong></p>
        <p>Not to make this all about <b>AKIRA</b> but I didn't draw that much before I got into it. It changed my life and made me realize a lot of things about myself. My art will always be dedicated to <b>AKIRA</b> in particular for how much it means to me. Otomo has become my favorite artist and main artistic inspiration.</p>
        <p>Otomo's work in general pushed me to get better at art. His growth over the decades reminds me that my art and style will always develop and get better if I put in the effort. Much like how he copied his inspirations, I copied his style when I was making my first <b>AKIRA</b> related art. Years later my art continues to change and become more my own while keeping his influence.</p>
        <p>Complicated machinery, wires, anatomy, buildings, all the small details. His art is rich and complex. I love his style; to me it's the most satisfying example of stylized realism. He's also rather "famous" for drawing small faces on big heads and his work often isn't "level" (i.e. didn't flip the canvas). But these imperfections make his style and they don't detract from it. I want to embrace these in my art as well.</p>
        <p>Experiencing Otomo's work feels like getting to see the best humanity can offer artistically and narratively. Yeah, I'm biased. This man changed so much in the world of animanga. Without his work, things would be very different for me and the world. It's kind of sad to see him get "forgotten" in a sense. He's famous but at the same time his work is "old-school" and not desired by the mainstream aside from turning it into a meme or aesthetic. No one really talks about him anymore. Maybe that's what he wants. Maybe not. I don't know him.</p>
        <p>Katsuhiro Otomo has been praised as a person we'll only see once in a lifetime and I believe it. I admire him greatly. Words can't describe the love I have for his work, especially <b>AKIRA.</b> I'm getting too sappy, this whole thing's been very sentimental...</p>
        <p>Thank you, Otomo.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container" id="current">
        <p><strong>CURRENT projects</strong></p>
        <p>During Anime Expo 2019, Otomo held a panel where he announced a few projects. To this day, he's been working on these the behind the scenes. His main focus has been...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Otomo: The Complete Works</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is Otomo's attempt to re-release everything he's ever worked on. A sort of archival project. From the comics that started his career to republishing the entirety of AKIRA as it was in <i>Young Magazine</i> and behind-the-scenes art books... it's literally everything.</p>
        <p>Most of these publications have been out of print for decades and never saw release outside of Japan. This allows both hardcore Otomo fans and people new to his work to experience all the work he's done so far, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
        <p>Books are still being produced. The first season concluded with "Animation AKIRA Layouts & Keyframes 3" in November 2024. You can visit the official Complete Works website <a href="https://otomo-complete.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AKIRA animated series</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An adaptation of the entire manga, Otomo would be directing. News has been quiet since the initial announcement. In 2022, someone asked Otomo about the status of the animated series and he said: "<a href="https://x.com/otomo_zenshu/status/1557708287381946369?t=DHTXIAc_8NDB3Lu8eLPihQ&amp;mx=2" target="_blank">I would like to know too.</a>" That seems bleak but animation takes time. COVID hit the world after it was announced. I still think we're getting it. This is my "PLUTO."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orbital Era</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Otomo's next animated film. No real news since the 2019 announcement. Otomo mentioned it in a tweet a year or two ago, asking for people to "wait a little longer." There's enough reason to believe it's still in production, just that Otomo is busy with the Complete Works.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unnamed manga</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Teased in a post on Twitter, Otomo mentioned that he's also working on a new manga series. There's no information about it currently.</p>
