        <p>The 1988 movie condenses the (then) half done story of AKIRA into two hours. It's a less accurate telling of AKIRA itself, more of an adaptation or interpretation. It's not AKIRA but it's AKIRA... Otomo himself has said that the movie was a "visual piece," not a "character piece." There's still a lot going on in it, though. The last volume released at that point was Volume 4. He never intended for AKIRA to be animated or adapted into a movie.</p>
        <p>AKIRA (1988) has been praised for the animation a million times. It was expensive, time consuming, and it used traditional cel animation to produce over 160,000 pictures. People reference and get inspired by the film itself all over the world every day. It's been called one of the best animated films of all time. This is all stuff you've heard before if you read about the movie.</p>
        <p>I wrote a <a href="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/articles/akira1988.html" target="_top"><b>review</b></a> of AKIRA (1988) from my perspective a while ago. I'll probably rewrite it at some point. Watching this movie is how I got AKIRA "back into" my life. I think the film is "perfect" but I recognize the flaws it has. It just makes me like it more--and all the work went into it for the shit people never talk about is even more appreciated.</p>

        <p class="section">PRODUCTION</p>
        <p><img src="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/shrines/akira_assets/mov-archives.jpg" style="border: 1px solid; float: inline-end; margin-left: 10px;">If you want to learn about the production of the movie from the source, watch <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzNbWe8qCMnvx6k5ESY-xyqK51QxVNfi&amp;si=Z8_5I59wHIi0WZoF" target="_blank"><b>the Production Report.</b></a> It's the best thing to watch related to the film in my opinion and gives a lot of insight. If I wrote anything more here, I think I'd just be summarizing the Report too much. The narrator is also funny sometimes.</p>
        <p>There's also one of the best AKIRA related books ever: AKIRA Animation Archives. It goes in depth about the process of the movie--layouts and design. Staff interviews. It has stuff in it you won't see otherwise. The graphic design of the book itself is also sick. If you like AKIRA, especially the movie, I really think you should get it.</p>

        <p class="title">Quick Action Recorder</p>
        <p>This film made use of the Quick Action Recorder<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxt0TygJdwI" target="_blank"><b><sup>?</sup></b></a> which allowed for animators to see the layouts in motion and confirm timing before they went onto paint the cels. This also made the pre-scoring process way easier. Images were taken using a top-down scanner and played in sequence. It's like watching back an animation in a modern program instead of flipping pages back and forth by hand.</p>

        <p class="title">Soundtrack</p>
        <p>The soundtrack was performed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi (<span style="font-family: MS Gothic; font-size: 12px;">芸能山城組</span>) and composed/conducted by Shoji Yamashiro. This group blends together MIDI synthesizers with traditional instruments. Otomo commissioned Shoji Yamashiro and the collective after hearing <i>Ecophony Rinne.</i> He was given no limits to his process and allowed to do whatever he wanted aside from a few basic themes. In the AKIRA Production Report, Shoji Yamashiro said that: "I wrote ... music that I wanted to hear, other people be damned."</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/shrines/akira_assets/mov-sound1.jpg" style="border: 1px solid;"> <img src="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/shrines/akira_assets/mov-sound2.jpg" style="border: 1px solid;"><br><sub>1994 disc</sub></p>
        <p>The soundtrack has 10 tracks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Kaneda</li>
            <li>Battle Against Clown (sometimes "Crown")</li>
            <li>Winds Over Neo-Tokyo (sometimes "the Neo-Tokyo")</li>
            <li>Tetsuo</li>
            <li>Dolls' Polyphony</li>
            <li>Shohmyoh</li>
            <li>Mutation</li>
            <li>Exodus From The Underground Fortress (or "Kaneda & Kei")</li>
            <li>Illusion</li>
            <li>Requiem</li>
        </ol>
        <p>AKIRA's soundtrack enhances the visuals and vice versa. Listening to the OST on it's own is just as great but it's hard not to imagine the parts of the movie the track goes with while listening. There's a release of the OST that also included audio and dialogue from the film itself. It was called AKIRA: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack...</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/shrines/akira_assets/mov-sound3.jpg" style="border: 1px solid;"></p>
        <p>The OST was also kind of re-released recently--in a remixed format. Disc 1 is all remixes by Makoto Kubota while disc 2 is remixes by Yasuharu Konishi. The cover was done by Otomo himself and it's probably the first time he's painted Kaneda's bike in a while.</p>
        <p>Personally I was excited for this remix and then it came out... I listened to the whole thing on a shift one night and some of the remixes are good but a lot of them feel like they take away more than they add. There's one remix where there's a British TTS voice saying random shit. It's hilarious and jarring--I don't think that was the intention. The best part of this whole release for me was Otomo doing the cover himself and the digipack the CDs come in.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately this is kind of the only way to listen to the OST digitally (officially, if you wanted it on streaming services, etc) if you don't have a physical copy. The OST used to be available online but I think rights issues and this coming out meant it had to get wiped. It's really disappointing. I own a CD and a vinyl but I want AKIRA with me 24/7 haha.</p>

        <p class="title">Computer Graphics</p>
        <p>The film used some very rudimentary CG for one thing and one thing only. The power signature reader. The colorful, moving sort of waveforms that the head scientist Onishi is obsessed with. I can't find much about this other than it getting mentioned in the Production Report and an old thread on X I wish I archived--it talked about what model of computer the work was done on. The CG work was done by a company called High Tech Lab Japan.</p>

        <p class="section">GAMES</p>
        <p>I didn't include something like this on the main page because all the games officially produced for AKIRA only ever followed the plot of the film. Very loosely... lol. A lot of these games are bad because of hardware limitations and the fact you can't really turn AKIRA into a game. Some of them never made it past development and died as prototypes.</p>
        <p class="title">Akira (Amiga) and Akira (Gameboy)</p>
        <p>I don't actually know anything about these. There's an Amiga <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6qxc1yIsbU" target="_blank"><b>longplay</b></a> on YouTube and I think it was produced by a British company? It looks fucking awful. Awesome. The description says it's one of the worst games ever made for the Amiga. Sounds right.</p>
        <p class="title">Akira (SNES)</p>
        <p>I think this was supposed to be similar to the Sega Genesis game? I don't know. This was a prototype that never got finished. Some sprite sheets are available on <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/snes/akiraprototypei/" target="_blank"><b>Spriters Resource.</b></a> I also found this image from some old games magazine that talks about it and shows a screenshot of the game:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/shrines/akira_assets/mov-snes.png" style="border: 1px solid;"><br><sub>"KANADA" lol</sub></p>
        <p class="title">AKIRA (Sega Genesis)</p>
        <p>I've actually played this prototype on an emulator. It's very bad. I don't have much to say about it because it's bad. When you're on the select screen a voice says "Kuhnayduh!" or "Tetsewoh!" when you hover a level. The music is ear-piercing sometimes.</p>
        <p>It's bad and it's funny and it just fucking bricks when you try to play the level based on the end of the movie. The level based on when I'm on the bridge also corrupts very quickly. The section with the flying platform made me want to puke. The sewer section where you play as Kaneda is the "best" because Kaneda kicking rats. This also has sheets on <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/sega_genesis_32x/akiraprototype/" target="_blank"><b>Spriters Resource</b></a> and some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B_Necq4WjM" target="_blank"><b>footage</b></a> on Youtube.</p>
        <p class="title">Akira (Famicom)</p>
        <p>Japan-only release but there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyUovTwbEiQ" target="_blank"><b>longplay</b></a> of the ENG fan translation on YouTube. There's an old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9gZ05PZ5ns" target="_blank"><b>trailer</b></a> as well. This game is... interesting. You play as Kaneda. It's a visual novel where you pick options from a list to progress. It's also bad and funny, the spritework fucking gets me sometimes. It's better than some of the other games but still jank. Gifs are from <a href="https://docpop.org/2017/06/gifs-akira-1988-video-game-nintendos-famicom-system/" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a></p>

        <p class="title">Akira Psycho Ball (PS2)</p>
        <p><img src="https://bokuwatetsuo.neocities.org/shrines/akira_assets/mov-psyball.jpg" style="border: 1px solid; float: left; margin-right: 13px;" height="180">In my opinion this is the only good AKIRA game. You can watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/0518wrhvQXA?si=qEWr_OvFh-lQ3Sqw" target="_blank"><b>longplay</b></a> of it on YouTube. This was made for me. I fucking love pinball games and I  want Psycho Ball but I don't have a usable PS2. This game was only released in Europe and Japan in 2002 and it was developed by KaZe Co, Ltd. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey_pdinkJXw" target="_blank"><b>soundtrack</b></a> is fucking GREAT but I'm mad that video doesn't have the Neo-Tokyo Race track. I like how the Geinoh Yamashirogumi sound was video-gamified. The level designs are cool, the pinball tables snapping together and changing around is sick.</p>
