        <p>AKIRA 1 begins with the first episode published in 1982 on December 6th and goes to episode 18, published in 1983 on September 5th. Depending on the version you read, this book has ~357 pages.</p>
        <p>I think most people reference AKIRA by sticking this book in the background of a shot or drawing. The cover alone is very iconic. I'm a contrarian so it's neither my favorite volume or cover and I kinda wish people would reference other volumes. I still REALLY like this volume because of the finale. I like it in both the sense of "I love these books" and how my fictionkinity affects my experience while engaging with AKIRA.</p>
        <p>It's the beginning of the end, I guess. The volume is named after me. I have a lot of feelings about Volume 1 that I don't know how to share. At the very least I can tell you it felt as insane as it is to read.</p>
        <p>This volume has some amazing art and it's the point in which you begin to see Otomo's artistic development from his late 70s style into his "AKIRA" style. I like his old style a lot but seeing it become more "AKIRA" is familiar. AKIRA feels very different from something like Fire-Ball or Domu. I think this fact is also influenced by the corrections he added during AKIRA's westernization. Some of those are only seen in the Dark Horse publication.</p>
        <p class="title">Favorite Panels</p>
        <p>I didn't scan the time slipper Kaneda but I scanned the rest. The shot of the back of Kaneda's head is one of ALL TIME FAVORITE panels.</p>
