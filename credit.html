        <p><span class="title">site graphics</span></p>
        <p>unless i say otherwise, none of the graphics on the site are mine. i'm not sure where most of them come from. if you do then comment on my site profile or guestbook or something and i'll list them here.</p>
        <p>any official AKIRA images used as site assets are drawn by katsuhiro otomo and aren't my work. i'm not claiming they are. i did scan/edit most of them myself. i'm not affiliated with kodansha or katsuhiro otomo, i just really like AKIRA.</p>
        <p><span class="title">my works</span></p>
        <p>anything with my name near it or my watermark on it. none of what i make is free to use, especially my art. don't use it for icons, banners, or whatever else you want to do. don't use it commercially. reuploading my work to other websites or networks is prohibited.</p>
        <p>just leave my work the fuck alone. look at it, enjoy it, hate it--i seriously don't care. but it's not yours to take or manipulate.</p>
