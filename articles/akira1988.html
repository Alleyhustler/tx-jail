        <h1>AKIRA (1988) FROM MY PERSPECTIVE</h1>
        <h2>POSTED 2025.01.30 <span title="UPDATED 2025.02.26" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">*</span></h2>
        <p>Until now, I've never thought about "reviewing" the movie because it's always been a spiritual 10/10. I know the history behind its production and I understand this movie inside and out. I appreciate AKIRA (1988) for what it is, flaws and all. It means a lot to me.</p>
        <p>But I realize that I don't have to write the usual kind of review. I want to lean into the fact that I'm someone who's technically in the movie. That makes this my first "real" article related to my fictionkin identity, then. This will be a "review" but I'm gonna go deeper into my personal relationship with it. I won't use the third person perspective when referring to myself (Tetsuo).</p>
        <p>Usual stuff out of the way. AKIRA is an animated movie, directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, that was released in Japan on July 16, 1988. It saw a limited release in the US on December 25, 1989. It's based off the manga of the same name and it was produced while the manga was still being published.</p>
        <p>Neo-Tokyo, 2019 A.D. Thirty-one years after World War III. The movie plot follows a motorcycle gang led by Sh&#333;tar&#333; Kaneda. ("The Capsules" is a fanon name). Kaneda and I are childhood friends, I'm in his gang. I make the mistake of going after some Clowns, trying to prove something, and end up crashing into this psychic kid named Takashi. That awakens psychic powers inside me and the movie unfolds from there as I cope with my new powers and Kaneda tries to find me. Lots of political unrest, action, commentary on humanity and hubris and all that good stuff.</p>
        <p>AKIRA is genuinely my favorite movie. It was a pioneer of animanga's popularity in the West at the time. Huge budget, fantastic animation, amazing OST by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, pre-scored dialogue... AKIRA has so much labor and humanity poured into it from Otomo and the AKIRA Committee. I don't think we'll ever get a movie like AKIRA again. And I'm always disappointed that it gets reduced down to digestible memes ("KANEDA! TETSUO!", "Leave me alone!", that fucking bike slide...) and clips for people to munch up.</p>
        <p>Anyways, the movie follows many of the same plot points as the manga but the two split from each other early on. Some people postulate that the movie is an alternate universe of the manga. Most complaints with the movie come from the fact that it was attempting to fit 3 and a half volumes (or what equates to that, episodes 1 through ~80 at the time) worth of plot into two hours. I agree with that. Or that it's too confusing. I never understood that complaint.</p>
        <p>From my perspective, the movie isn't an "alternate universe." No fucking way. It's just a movie made <i>about</i> a story made about me and the people I knew. An interpretation of an interpretation using the same characters. Not that it's a bad one, just different.</p>
        <p>Part of this does come from the fact the movie condensed the manga. How can you capture everything that happened in just two hours? It's not possible. It became even more of a story than AKIRA itself being a story. AKIRA (movie) is that overly-dramatized version of things, very flashy and awesome, but not as accurate as AKIRA (manga).</p>
        <p>Despite all this the movie was my introduction to source (AKIRA). Because of it I was able to realize that I am -- and maybe always was -- Tetsuo. My username "bokuwatetsuo" came from my last line in the movie, even if the username predates my "awakening."</p>
        <p>I still get affected watching it. There's details from the movie that actually influenced some of my memories. The sound and visuals help with that. Kaneda's VA sounds exactly like how I remember him. Seeing Neo-Tokyo in motion like that makes it easier for me to remember it, even if it only gets glorified as "cyberpunk aesthetic" by most.</p>
        <p>The one thing that connects me to the movie is my relationship with Kaori. Not us dating (hate) but her being a friend. Someone who understands me and I can confide in without all the pain. It's an escape from how things actually were. (Which were bad but not properly depicted in the manga either. Go figure.)</p>
        <p>It's kind of weird. I'm in the movie but the movie doesn't feel "real." Not "grounded." My identity is fictional, but the movie is like... fiction-fiction. When I read the manga, I'm basically reliving memories and it's a heavy experience. It's "real" and it's mostly accurate. Despite what might be wrong.</p>
        <p>With the movie, it's like they took the cliff notes of my (and everyone else's) narrative and made something else off of that. It's still the best movie ever -- maybe just because I'm in it (lol). I get engrossed in it and it's fucking awesome, but at the end of the day it's really just a movie. Something that's fun.</p>
        <p>AKIRA (1988), or AKIRA as a whole, is probably the peak of humanity. In the beginning of this I said that AKIRA (1988) is a spiritual 10/10. It definitely is. That movie is everything to me. Realistically I'd place it at an 8.5/10.</p>
        <p>Otomo walked out during the first screening and told his wife it was a failure. That's a harsh sentiment but I understand where this came from. Massive cuts, budget running out... he wanted it to be more. Every time I read the storyboards I feel frustrated too, because there's a lot more we could have seen.</p>
