        <h1>learn to be ignored</h1>
        <h2>POSTED 2025.02.28 <span title="UPDATED 2025.04.09" style="text-decoration: underline dotted;">*</span></h2>
        <p>Disclaimer since this is going on a public website: I'm not stupid. I know this rant or these issues don't apply for every interaction someone who's fictionkin might have with someone who isn't, but there's a lot of times where it does.</p>
        <p>///</p>
        <p>One thing I learned very quickly about being fictionkin is that people will ignore you. They engage with you but they do it like "you" aren't there. There's refusal to acknowledge a fictionkin's experience or identity because they "don't believe in it." There's also the whole "I'm not feeding your delusions" thing.</p>
        <p>A third option is if someone happens to be a character they REALLY like. I guess people don't enjoy the idea of treating someone like their precious "blorbo" or glorified "meow meow" or whatever. You shouldn't do that with real people so apparently there's no normal way to approach a conversation and that leads to them getting "squicked out."</p>
        <p>So instead it's easier for people to alienate themselves from fictionkind just because it's an atypical experience. And, no, I don't want to force people to "believe" in anything. Personally I don't give a shit if someone doesn't believe me. I know who I am.</p>
        <p>But I don't think it's as difficult as people make it out to be; to respect or acknowledge this identity or an individual, in spite of what you might "believe."</p>
        <p>The knee-jerk reaction to call someone who's fictionkind "delusional" gets so fucking tiring. Just because someone thinks something strange doesn't mean they're delusional. People who label all of us as delusional for just "having a false belief or opinion" should fall under scrutiny based on their own logic.</p>
        <p>Everyday someone believes something that can't necessarily be proven. But it's generally accepted as "true" because it's a personal experience. If "having a false belief or opinion" is ALL it takes, then everyone alive is delusional. Even anti-kin. But I'm sure they would say "at least I'm not delulu about being a fictional character lol" or whatever.</p>
        <p>If someone said "yeah my experience is influenced by delusion," why would that matter? How does that invalidate who they are as a person? So long as no one's getting hurt, who or what someone thinks they are/were; a fictional character, animal, or whatever -- no matter how that identity came into existence -- isn't anyone's business.</p>
        <p>I couldn't give a shit, at least. Assuming all people who think atypical things are delusional (aka bad, wrong, scary I guess) and need to be "cured" or "fixed" is fucking shit.</p>
        <p>Reactions to fictionkind have always been pretty bad because of "kinning;" a fandom hobby about relating to or roleplaying as fictional characters, using terms that originated with fictionkind. The "kin for fun" people which came around a decade ago from anti-kin beliefs.</p>
        <p>Most people who "do kinning for fun" or whatever don't even know the real origins of their own hobby. And a lot of people think that fictionkin are the ones who "take it too far" when we're not even in the same category.</p>
        <p>A lot act this way because a lot of anti-kin sentiments are about control, not genuine concern. I guess some people are concerned but they still refuse to listen to the person they're "concerned" for when that person says they're not even in need of help.</p>
        <p>If someone says "I'm not delusional" or "That's none of your business" or "I don't care what you think" then it's about fictionkin being difficult freaks who take everything too seriously and demand everything from everyone. Violating the precious comfort of the accuser.</p>
        <p>They end up coming off less like "I'm concerned for you because I'm thinking of your safety" and more like "I don't understand how your brain works, but also don't understand that it isn't really my business. So stop being so weird, it makes ME uncomfortable." Whatever reasoning, it says way more about whoever's spouting that rhetoric than it does about the person who's fictionkin.</p>
        <p>Everyone says they want more people to be weird and happy with themselves and have fun. But not too weird. OK. Just stop fucking worrying about the experiences of people you don't know. People think this shit is ridiculous and outlandish, and being fictionkin is strange, yeah, but I don't think it's hard to ask for respect.</p>
        <p>Fuck whoever's gonna see me as delusional and disrespect me no matter what I say or feel.</p>
